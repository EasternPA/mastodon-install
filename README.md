# mastodon-install
Instructions for hosting a small Mastodon server instance for free (well, *almost*) using docker compose

# Introduction

Mastodon is a micro-blogging application (similar in style to Twitter) that uses ActivityPub as the federation protocol on the backend. Mastodon is just one of several social networking applications in the Fediverse. You can learn more at [fediverse.party](https://fediverse.party).

This document provides step-by-step instructions for hosting an instance of Mastodon for almost no cost (under $11USD for the first 2 years).

I tried to follow numerous instructional documents that had been assembled over the years, but I needed to combine (and tweak) steps from each of these documents in order to arrive at a working configuration. The steps explained below were drawn from the following documents, and I thank each of the authors for their contributions to this space.

# Assumptions
Familiarity with Linux, domain registration, DNS management, and web hosting, including SSL encryption.

# Prerequisites

1. Paid domain name that works with Let's Encrypt
1. Domain reconfigured to use Cloudflare for DNS
1. A Virtual Private Server (VPS) on Oracle Cloud's Free Tier
1. An SSH public key for logging into your OS image (run `ssh-keygen` in Linux)

## Register for a free Cloudflare account

Register at https://cloudflare.com

## Buy a domain
Let's Encrypt offers free SSL certificates for domain owners, but they do not make it easy get certificates for Top Level Domains (TLDs) you can get for free at various websites. I prefer the easy web UI method, and that requires a domain with a non-free TLD. Namecheap has been selling domains ending in `.xyz` for $10.38 for the first 2 years and they work fine for this. Domains that end in `.social` cost just a little more and tend to be more popular on the Fediverse.

## Migrate the DNS to Cloudflare
Cloudflare will give you the two DNS servers assigned to manage your account. The process to change the DNS servers managing your domain will vary by registrar and is done at your registrar's site. Update the DNS servers at your registrar to point to the two servers given to you by Cloudflare.

## Register for a free Oracle Cloud account

Note: You must set `Shields Down` for this site if you use the _Brave_ browser. The website will not function properly with the shields up.

## Setup Ingress rules the first time you set up a virtual cloud network
Ensure that you have IPv4 https ingress enabled for your virtual cloud network.  In Oracle Cloud, from the main menu
1. Choose Networking
1. Select Virtual Cloud Networks
1. Click on the virtual cloud network you previously created
1. Click on the subnet you previously created
1. Click on the Default Security List for the virtual cloud network.
1. Select Ingress Rules on the left if Ingress Rules are not already displayed
1. Click on Add Ingress Rules
1. Choose Stateless, CIDR, 0.0.0.0/0, TCP, All (blank), 443, https, and click on Add Ingress Rule


## Create an AlwaysFree instance on Oracle Cloud
1. Change the name of the instance to `mastodon` if you do not plan to host other Fedi services; use `fediverse` if you do
1. Click `Edit` in the `Image and Shape` section
1. Click the `Change image` button next to `Oracle Linux 8`
1. Select Canonical Ubuntu for the image
1. Click `Select image` at the bottom
1. Click the `Change shape` button next to `AMD VM Standard`
1. Select `Ampere` from the `Shape Series` options list
1. Select the only shape available on the `Shape name` list
1. Configure it with a minimum of 1 CPU and 6 GB RAM; use more if you will host several users
1. Click `Select Shape` at the bottom
1. Note you may need to create a new virtual cloud network and a new public subnet if this the first time you have created a compute instance.  If so, choose create a new virtual cloud network and create a new public subnet, give each of them a name, and ensure that Assign a public IPv4 address is selected.  Otherwise, it should default to Select existing virtual cloud network and Select existing subnet.
1. Scroll down beyond the `Networking` section of the configuration panel
1. Upload the public keyfile you generated for SSH logins (located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`)
1. Click `Create` at the bottom
1. Wait 10 minutes for the instance to start
1. Locate the IP address in the top right corner of the instance information panel
1. Copy the IP address to the clipboard

## Create a DNS entry for your instance
1. Go to your Cloudflare dashboard in another browser tab
1. Click DNS from the main menu
1. Click Create to create a new DNS record
1. Choose `A` for the record type
1. Enter `fediverse` for the hostname, and paste the IP address for your cloud server instance
1. Choose `DNS Only` for the `Proxy status` option
1. Click Save
1. Click Create to create another DNS record
1. Choose `CNAME` for the record type
1. Enter `mstdn` for the hostname and `fediverse.` followed by the full domain name you purchased (i.e. `fediverse.mydomain.com`)
1. Choose `DNS Only` for the `Proxy status` option
1. Click Save

# Installation

## Install `docker` and `docker-compose`

### Update image to prepare for `docker` installation

1. `ssh ubuntu@mstdn.<mydomain.tld>` (replace `<mydomain.tld>` with the domain you purchased)
Note that if the name fails to resolve within 10 minutes after updating your DNS, double check your work at Cloudflare

1. `sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade -y`
1. Once the upgrade completes, hit enter on `Ok` then `<tab>` and `<enter>` on the next screen
1. `sudo reboot`
1. Wait about 45 seconds for the server to reboot and log back in with `ssh ubuntu@mstdn.mydomain.com` (again, replacing `mydomain.com`)

Note: If the upgrade does not proceed through to the end as expected, you may need to destroy and recreate the image. This happened to me once while developing these instructions.

### Install `docker`
Install dependencies:
1. `sudo apt install ca-certificates curl ufw apt-transport-https software-properties-common git -y`

Configure firewall:
1. `sudo ufw allow OpenSSH`
1. `sudo ufw enable`
1. `sudo ufw allow http`
1. `sudo ufw allow https`
1. `sudo ufw status`

to verify the ufw status

Install docker for linux as per the instructions at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

Add the GPG key for the `docker` repository to apt:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

Add the `docker` repository:

```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Update the package index

`sudo apt-get update`

Note: I do not like to add my non-root user to the docker group as this grants broad powers to the user. Just use `sudo` for commands that require `root` privileges, such as `docker` and `docker compose`.

Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose:
`sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin`

Run `sudo docker run hello-world` and check that docker hello world runs

Run `docker compose version` and ensure the current version number is returned

## Install `mastodon`

### Download and edit the mastodon docker compose

1. `mkdir mastodon`
1. `cd mastodon`
1. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mastodon/mastodon/main/docker-compose.yml`
1. Open `docker-compose.yml` for editing using `vi` or `nano`, whichever you're comfortable using
1. Comment out each line with `build: .`: `sed -i 's/build: ./#build: ./' docker-compose.yml`
2. 
### Initialize the database

1. `date | md5sum`

You will see output like this:

`e351f61406c8ba6bdc489fdc4606c7c3  -`

Copy the long string into your clipboard. Do not include the space or `-` at the end. You will paste it where you see `<pg pwd>` below (two places!)

```
sudo docker run --name postgres14 -v /home/ubuntu/mastodon/postgres14:/var/lib/postgresql/data -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<pg pwd> --rm -d postgres:14-alpine
sudo docker exec -it postgres14 psql -U postgres
```

At the `postgres=#` command line, run:

`CREATE USER mastodon WITH PASSWORD '<pg pwd>' CREATEDB;`

Note: include the single quotes `'` in the above command. Look for `CREATE ROLE` in the response. If successful, type `exit`.

Next, stop the container:

`sudo docker stop postgres14`

### Build the web application

Prepare the configuration file:
1. `touch .env.production`
1. Open another terminal window and `ssh` into your host again
1. Return to your first window

Start the web application setup:
1. `sudo docker compose run --rm -e DISABLE_DATABASE_ENVIRONMENT_CHECK=1 web bundle exec rake mastodon:setup`

Answer the prompts:
- `Domain name:` - enter `mstdn.<yourdomain.tld>` replacing `<yourdomain.tld>` with the domain name you purchased

Hit `<Enter>` to accept all of the defauts below:
1. `Single user mode` - hit enter for `(N)o`
1. `Are you using Docker?` - hit enter for `(Y)es`
1. `PostgreSQL host` - hit enter for the default
1. `PostgreSQL port` - hit enter for the default
1. `Name of PostgreSQL database` - hit enter for the defualt
1. `Name of PostgreSQL user` - hit enter for the default
1. `Password of PostgreSQL user` - copy/paste in your PostgreSQL password generated earlier
1. `Redis host` - hit enter for the default
1. `Redis port` - hit enter for the default
1. `Redis password` - hit enter for the default
1. `Store uploaded files on the cloud?` - hit enter for the default

Email configuration - Continue hitting Enter on the defaults:
1. `Send emails from localhost?` - hit enter for the default
1. `SMTP server` - hit enter for the default
1. `SMTP port` - hit enter for the default
1. `SMTP username` - hit enter for the default
1. `SMTP password` - hit enter for the default
1. `SMTP authentication` - hit enter for the default
1. `SMTP OpenSSL verify mode` - hit enter for the default `none`
1. Address to use as `From` for notification emails - hit enter for the default

Hit `n` when asked to send a test e-mail. The configuation above is invalid and will not work. That's okay.
1. `Send a test e-mail now?` - hit `N` for No

You will see a notice that it will be written to `.env.production`. Hit enter to display the contents.

When you see the suggested contents of `.env.production` shown, WAIT

1. Copy the suggested contents of `.env.production` into the clipboard
1. Switch to your secondary `ssh` session
2. `cd mastodon`
3. Edit `.env.production` with `vi` or `nano`, whichever you're comfortable using
4. Paste in the contents of `.env.production` from the clipboard
5. Save and exit (`Ctrl-s, Ctrl-x` in `nano` or `<Esc>:wq<Enter>` in `vi`)
6. `sudo docker compose run --rm web bundle exec rake secret`
7. Copy the secret into the clipboard
8. Open `.env.production` again for editing
9. Locate the `SECRETS` section
10. Add another secret called `PAPERCLIP_SECRET=` and paste the value you just created
11. Save and exit the `.env.production` file
12. Switch back to your primary `ssh` session

Continue with the setup process

1. `Prepare the database now?` - Hit enter for `(Y)es`. You should see `Done!` after a few seconds.
1. `Create an admin user?` - Hit `n` for `(N)o` and hit enter

The setup script will exit.

### Prepare the final build
Run `sudo docker compose up -d && sleep 15 && sudo docker compose down`

Ensure some critical file permissions are correct:

`sudo chown -R 70:70 ./postgres14`

`sudo chown -R 991:991 ./public`

## Stand up the mastodon stack
`sudo docker compose up -d`

## Add NPM to your `docker compose` stack

1. Run `date | md5sum` twice to generate two new passwords: one for the NPM MySQL root account and one for the database
1. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` with `vi` or `nano`, whichever you prefer
1. Copy and paste the content below to add `NPM` immediately above the `networks:` section at the end of the `services:` section in your `docker-compose.yml`. Ensure the `volumes:` section is fully outdented to the first column. Replace the NPM MySQL root password with one of the hashes above and replace the NPM MySQL non-root password (in two places!) with the other hash from above.

```
  npm-db:
    image: jc21/mariadb-aria:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<NPM MySQL root pwd>
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=npm
      - MYSQL_USER=npm
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=<NPM MySQL pwd>
    volumes:
      - npm-db:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - internal_network

  npm-app:
    image: jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "81:81"
      - "443:443"
    environment:
      - DB_MYSQL_HOST=npm-db
      - DB_MYSQL_PORT=3306
      - DB_MYSQL_USER=npm
      - DB_MYSQL_PASSWORD=<NPM MySQL DB pwd>
      - DB_MYSQL_NAME=npm
    volumes:
      - npm-data:/data
      - npm-ssl:/etc/letsencrypt
    networks:
      - external_network
      - internal_network


volumes:
  npm-db:
  npm-ssl:
  npm-data:
```

1. Save and exit
1. Run `docker compose up -d` to add `NPM` services to your stack
1. Run the `exit` command to logout of the server instance
1. Run `ssh` to log back in, but add `-L 8081:localhost:81` to the end of the ssh command line. This will let you configure `NPM` via the web UI.
1. Pull up `http://localhost:8081` in your browser
1. Log into NPM using `admin@example.com` and `changeme` as the credentials
1. Update the registration fields with your name, nickname, and a strong password

1. Verify that you can log back in with your non-admin username/password

# Increasing the toot character limit.

Many instances allow more than 500 characters for a toot, but Mastodon does not allow this out of the box, and this isn't configurable.

However, it is fairly straightforward to increase the limit on a standard docker install (and, if you've got to this point, you have a standard docker install), so if you want a higher character limit, then this next option is for you.

1. Make sure you are in your mastodon directory `cd mastodon`
2. Edit a script with your favorite editor - if you are going to make your character limit 2000, name your script 2000.sh, for example
3. Edit the `2000.sh` with `vi` or `nano`, whichever you prefer e.g. `nano 2000.sh`
4. Paste in the following contents, and save the file (change 2000 to 5000 if you choose a 5000 character limit in the lines 2 and 3 below)
```
#!/bin/bash
sudo docker compose exec web sed -i 's/500/2000/g' app/javascript/mastodon/features/compose/components/compose_form.js
sudo docker compose exec web sed -i 's/500/2000/g' app/validators/status_length_validator.rb
sudo docker compose exec web sed -i 's/:registrations/:registrations, :max_toot_chars /g' app/serializers/rest/instance_serializer.rb
sudo docker compose exec web sed -i 's/private/def max_toot_chars\n 2000\n end\n\n private/g' app/serializers/rest/instance_serializer.rb
sudo docker compose exec web bundle exec rails assets:precompile && echo "pass" || echo "fail"
sudo docker compose restart
``` 
6. Make the script executable with `chmod +x 2000.sh`
7. Run the script with `sudo .\2000.sh`
8. Wait about a minute for your Mastodon instance to restart, and enjoy longer toots.

# Keeping your instance up-to-date

Keeping your instance updated is pretty easy with docker and docker compose.

1. `ssh` into your Oracle Cloud instance
2. `cd mastodon`
3. `sudo docker compose pull`
4. Wait until all activity completes
5. `sudo docker compose stop`
6. Wait several seconds
7. `sudo docker compose start`

Wait up to a minute before reloading the web page or attempting to use the app. If you try too soon, you may see an `error 502` bad gateway when you try to reload the page. Also, use the keyboard shortcut of Ctrl-Shift-R to flush the browser cache for the page before reloading.

That should do it. If you are generally unfamiliar with these tools as a system administrator, you may wish to wait for a few days after major updates have been released, as that gives time for possible bugs to be discovered and addressed.
